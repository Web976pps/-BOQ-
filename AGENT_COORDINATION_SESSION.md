## üö® **CRITICAL BUG DIAGNOSIS - MULTI-AGENT FINDINGS**

### **üîç Root Cause Analysis:**
**All agents have identified the same critical issues:**

1. **Zone Polygon Creation FAILURE**
   - All zones show "Shapely Polygon: ‚ùå"
   - Geometric containment cannot work without polygons
   - Fallback to distance-based method also failing

2. **OCR Position Data Mismatch**
   - Extracted codes: `['C0PA', 'CH31', 'TB12', ...]`
   - OCR words: `['E', 'CH1I6H15A', 'TBOTBO2', 'CREATE', 'STORAGE']`
   - **COMPLETE DISCONNECT** between extracted codes and OCR positions

3. **Text Processing Pipeline Issue**
   - Codes extracted by one method (enhanced OCR)
   - Position data comes from different OCR pass
   - Association logic cannot match them

### **üéØ IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:**
**Agent-Alpha coordinating emergency fix deployment...**
